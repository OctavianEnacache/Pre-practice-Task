# Pre-practice-Task
I have created a Google Doc, developed a presentation in English, and uploaded code to GitHub for connecting IoT devices (like Raspberry Pi, ESP, Pycom, Arduino, Libelium, Galileo, Android, etc.) via MQTT to a database. I enable storage on blockchain platforms such as Ethereum, IOTA, and Hyperledger. I orchestrate services using Docker and Arrowhead, and display data in a mobile application. I utilize Node-RED for data processing, visualize data in Grafana, set up notifications within Grafana, and configure local data storage in a directory named after me. Additionally, I implement auto-resynchronization of local data with the cloud in case of power or network failures, and enable data querying via a chatbot or voicebot.
